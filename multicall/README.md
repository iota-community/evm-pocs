# MultiCall Example

This is a minimal reproduction of a MultiCall call that simulates both view call
functionality and simulated transaction functionality. The example works
out of the box with the ShimmerEVM Testnet, just run `node example.js` after a
`npm install` to see it work. If you wish to deploy these contracts yourself 
they are provided in the `contracts/` folder.
